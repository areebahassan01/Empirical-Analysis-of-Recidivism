# Empirical-Analysis-of-Recidivism
The project focuses on evaluating the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) algorithm, widely used by judges, probation officers, and parole officers to predict recidivism. 

Our central question revolves around the potential bias in the COMPAS algorithm, particularly concerning race, and the overall accuracy of COMPAS in predicting reoffending. 

Bias is a prevalent issue in algorithms like these, and it has the potential to significantly affect the recidivism scores the system displays. This is crucial because it's possible that the COMPAS algorithm will have an impact on the lives of prisoners who are making positive changes in their lives. Thus, we would like to know if COMPAS is accurate in and of itself, and if the data generated by the algorithm is biased with respect to race.


We employed two sets of data for our project: a raw data file and a two-year data file that indicated whether or not the convicted individuals had committed new crimes during that time.
We began with the raw file, cleaned it up, and ran hypothesis tests and EDA to see how the recommended supervision level and decile score—a scale of 1 to 10 that indicates the likelihood of a convicted person committing another crime—were distributed among the races in our data. On the two-year data file, we then carried out the same procedure.
